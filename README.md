# Graph Coloring Algorithm

This project implements a graph coloring algorithm using C++. The algorithm helps find the best colors for vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

## Description

The project can be helpful to both customers and companies:
- **Consumer Perspective:** Helps buyers decide on cars within their budget.
- **Company Perspective:** Assists companies in setting competitive car prices based on market trends.

Utilizing supervised learning approaches like "Linear Regression" and "Decision Trees," this project generates automotive price projections to obtain lower-priced cars with desired features.

## Code Usage

In this project, we have used the Dev C++ application to run the code.

### Example Inputs:
- Total number of vertices and edges: `4 5`
- Edge vertices:
