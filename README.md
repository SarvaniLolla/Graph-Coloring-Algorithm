# Graph Coloring Algorithm

This project implements a graph coloring algorithm using C++. The algorithm helps find the best colors for vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

## Description

The project can be helpful to both customers and companies:
- **Consumer Perspective:** Helps buyers decide on cars within their budget.
- **Company Perspective:** Assists companies in setting competitive car prices based on market trends.

Utilizing supervised learning approaches like "Linear Regression" and "Decision Trees," this project generates automotive price projections to obtain lower-priced cars with desired features.

## Code Usage

After running the code in Dev c++ application, we need to enter the inputs. For instance, we have 
taken the inputs as follows: 
Total number of edges and vertices: 4 5
enter edge vertices of edge 1: 1 2
enter edge vertices of edge 2: 2 3
enter edge vertices of edge 3: 3 4
enter edge vertices of edge 4: 4 1
enter edge vertices of edge 5: 2 4

The results obtained is:
Vertex 1 is coloured with 1st color.
Vertex 2 is coloured with 2nd color.
Vertex 3 is coloured with 1st color.
Vertex 4 is coloured with 3rd color.
